## 2020

[productboard](https://www.productboard.com/) is heavily investing into Kotlin, so that made this year's choice quite easy!

1. [Report Repair](./2020/1.kts), find combinations in a cartesian product summing to 2020
1. [Password Philosophy](./2020/2.kts), validate strings by some criteria
1. [Toboggan Trajectory](./2020/3.kts), explore number of collisions on a straight paths on a 2D plane
1. [Passport Processing](./2020/4.kts), validate strings by some criteria, a bit more parsing then #2
1. [Binary Boarding](./2020/5.kts), following a binary search, finding a gap in a sequence
1. [Custom Customs](./2020/6.kts), union and intersection of elements in a set
1. [Handy Haversacks](./2020/7.kts), counting how many trees contain an element, count number of weighed elements in a tree
1. [Handheld Halting](./2020/8.kts), simulating a VM
1. [Encoding Error](./2020/9.kts), finding a contiguous sequence summing up to a number
1. [Adapter Array](./2020/10.kts), counting number of possible paths through a graph with memoization
1. [Seating Systems](./2020/11.kts), 2D celullar automaton
1. [Rain Risk](./2020/12.kts), simulation of moving object on a 2D grid
1. [Shuttle Search](./2020/13.kts), finding an number satysfing a set of linear equations with Modulo

## 2019

[productboard](https://www.productboard.com/) is a big fan of Typescript, so that made this year's choice quite easy!

## 2018

This time all in Scala.

1. [Chronal Calibration](./2018/1.scala), summing ints and finding first duplicate value on a random walk
1. [Inventory Management System](./2018/2.scala), filtering strings by some criteria
1. [No Matter How You Slice It](./2018/3.scala), counting interesting rectangles on a plane
1. [Repose Record](./2018/4.scala), event simulation with some over-midnight tricky handling
1. [Alchemical Reduction](./2018/5.scala), removing pairs of consecutive lower/upper case chars in a string
1. [Chronal Coordinates](./2018/6.scala), a square grid version of Voronoi diagrams based on Manhattan distance
1. [The Sum of Its Parts](./2018/7.scala), *topological sort* of tasks, part two with a spin where workers work in parallel
1. [Memory Maneuver](./2018/8.scala), *recursive parser* building a tree, then some easy traversal
1. [Marble Mania](./2018/9.scala), a simple game on a *circular buffer*
1. [The Stars Align](./2018/10.scala), a simulation where points at an unknown time align to produce a message, no OCR implemented, just analytically determine the meeting point and wait
1. [Chronal Charge](./2018/11.scala), finding the square sub-matrix of any size with largest sum of values
1. [Subterranean Sustainability](./2018/12.scala), a 1D cellular automaton, part two requires finding a repeating pattern

1. [Settlers of The North Pole](./2018/18.scala), 2D cellular automaton
1. [Go With The Flow](./2018/19.scala), implementing jumps in #16, part two requires understanding the assembly code and inlining an inefficient loop

1. [Chronal Conversion](./2018/21.scala), building on #16 and #19, requires understanding the assembly code and finding a way to make it exit early by controlling a register
1. [Mode Maze](./2018/22.scala), implementing shortest path (Dijkstra) on a graph representing cave exploration
1. [Experimental Emergency Teleportation](./2018/23.scala), finding a point which most subsets contain, implemented using a SAT-solver, Z3
1. [Immune System Simulator 20XX](./2018/24.scala), turn-based simulation similar to #15 with another set of tie-breakers
1. [Four-Dimensional Adventure](./2018/25.scala), finding the number of components in a graph

## 2015

Solving http://adventofcode.com/, one programming language per puzzle

1. [Ruby](./2015/1/1.rb), to get started
2. [C](./2015/2/2.c), pulling out the old `scanf` loop
3. [Java](./2015/3/src/com/github/vvondra/Main.java), because it got has sets
4. [Python](./2015/4/4.py), which I should have probably left for something harder
5. [Go](./2015/5/5.go), still figuring out if I like the language or not
6. [Haskell](./2015/6/6.hs), probably horribly inefficient, but very fun figuring out the right structure
7. [Rust](./2015/7/src/7.rs), scarred for life by trying to borrow a mutable reference
8. [PHP](./2015/8/8.php), back to the roots
9. [Prolog](./2015/9/9.pl), sweet and short for backtracking the Traveling Santa
10. [Clojure](./2015/10/10.clj), failing to understanding the meaning of *juxtaposition* but still using it
11. [C#](./2015/11/11.cs), is it IEnumerable or IEnumerator?
12. [Node.js](./2015/12/12.js), best fit to parse JSON soup
13. [R](./2015/13/13.R), to generate all the permutations
14. [awk](./2015/14/14.awk)
15. [Scala](./2015/15/15.scala), combinations are conveniently in standard library
16. [Julia](./2015/16/16.ipynb), new kid on the block
