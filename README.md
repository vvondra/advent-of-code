# advent-of-code

Solving http://adventofcode.com/, one programming language per puzzle

1. Ruby, to get started
2. C, pulling out the old `scanf` loop
3. Java, because it got easy to use hash sets
4. Python, which I should have probably left for something harder
5. Go, still figuring out if I like the language or not
6. Haskell, probably horribly inefficient, but very fun figuring out the right structure
7. Rust, scarred for life by trying to borrow a mutable reference
8. tbd
9. Prolog, sweet and short for backtracking the Traveling Santa
10. Clojure, failing to define the meaning of *juxtaposition* like always
11. C#, is it IEnumerable or IEnumerator?
12. Node.js, best fit to parse JSON soup
