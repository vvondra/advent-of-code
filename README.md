# advent-of-code

Solving http://adventofcode.com/, one programming language per puzzle

1. Ruby, to get started
2. C, pulling out the old `scanf` loop
3. Java, because it got easy to use hash sets
4. Python, which I should have probably left for something harder
5. Go, still figuring out if I like the language or not
6. Haskell, probably horribly inefficient, but very fun figuring out the right structure
7. tbd
8. Bash, for some plain char counting
9. Prolog, sweet and short for backtracking the Traveling Santa
10. Clojure, failing to define the meaning of *juxtaposition* like always
